A telegram bot for viewing and searching for **[Number Pyramid objects](https://oenp.tusur.ru/)**. Bot is available by this link: <https://t.me/oenp_bot>

The bot is written using aiogram package and is also able to load pyramid data to **[telegram channel](t.me/oenp_tusur)**.

To run bot that would post pyramids data to telegram channel run `python3 load_pyramids_to_channel`.

### **TODO**:

- [] Create proper CLI tool to run bot and to post pyramid data to channel;
- [] Refactor code and make python package from this repo;
